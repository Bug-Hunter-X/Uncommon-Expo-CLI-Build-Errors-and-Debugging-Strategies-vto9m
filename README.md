# Uncommon Expo CLI Build Errors and Debugging Strategies

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered while using Expo CLI and provides debugging strategies.

The error often manifests as cryptic error messages during the build process. This can be attributed to complexities in the project setup, conflicts between native modules and the Expo build system, or incompatibility between dependencies.  Effective debugging requires careful analysis of the detailed build logs generated by Expo.

## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Attempt to build the project using `expo build:android` or `expo build:ios` (replace with your target platform).
3. Observe the detailed output from the build command. This is crucial for identifying the root cause.

## Debugging Strategies

1. **Analyze Build Logs:**  Thoroughly examine the output of the `expo build` command. Look for warnings or errors related to native modules, dependencies, or build configurations.
2. **Dependency Version Check:** Ensure all dependencies are compatible with the Expo SDK version and each other. Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to understand dependency trees and check version compatibility.
3. **Native Module Configuration:** If you're using native modules, verify their configurations are correct for the Expo environment. Ensure linking, build settings, and dependencies are properly defined.
4. **Simplified Reproduction:** If possible, create a minimal reproducible example to isolate the problem. This will help pinpoint the source of the error more effectively.
5. **Expo Community Support:** Seek help in the Expo community forums or GitHub issues. Provide the detailed build logs and relevant project information to get assistance.
