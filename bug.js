This error occurs when using Expo CLI with a project that has a complex or unusually configured build process.  The exact cause is difficult to pinpoint as it stems from interactions between Expo's build system and native modules or custom build scripts.  Debugging this requires careful examination of the build logs for any warnings or errors related to native module linking, build configurations, or dependencies. Consider checking if there is a mismatch in versions between the Expo CLI and the Expo SDK used in your project. Also, check that all your dependencies are compatible with the Expo environment.
