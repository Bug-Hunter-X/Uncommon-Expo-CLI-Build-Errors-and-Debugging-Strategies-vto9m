The solution to this type of error depends heavily on the specific error message and the project configuration.  The examples below illustrate common scenarios and approaches.

**Scenario 1: Native Module Linking Issues**

* **Problem:** An error message related to a native module not being linked correctly.  This often involves platform-specific build settings.
* **Solution:** Review the native module's documentation and ensure you've followed the instructions for linking it correctly within your Expo project.

```javascript
// Example: Checking for correct linking in Android
// Consult the documentation for specific commands to check linking for your modules
// ... 
```

**Scenario 2: Dependency Conflicts**

* **Problem:** Incompatibilities between project dependencies.  The error message might not be explicit but the build fails.
* **Solution:** Use `npm ls` or `yarn why` to examine the project's dependency tree. Identify any version conflicts or incompatible packages.  Use version ranges or specific versions to resolve conflicts.

```javascript
// Example: package.json with explicit dependency version
{
  "dependencies": {
    "react-native-unimodules": "^0.16.0",
    "expo": "^47.0.12"
  }
}
```

**Scenario 3: Expo SDK Version Mismatch**

* **Problem:** The Expo SDK version in the project does not align with the Expo CLI version.
* **Solution:** Update both the Expo CLI and Expo SDK to the latest compatible versions.

```bash
// Update Expo CLI
expo upgrade

// Update the SDK (in package.json)
{
  "dependencies": {
    "expo": "^",
  }
}
```
Always refer to the detailed error messages and logs. These provide the most crucial clues for resolving uncommon Expo CLI build errors.
